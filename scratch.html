            <p class="par">Math can seem incredibly drab and boring at times, especially when its uses are unclear. However, I think that linear algebra <br>
                is able to avoid this problem due to it being used in a so many diverse ways. From it being used in computers all the time through <br>
                search engine results or programs that have the abilities to zoom in to it being the basis for most or even all of statistics, linear <br>

             <p class="par">Of course, it can be easy to lose interest in something when it doesn't make much sense, and in linear algebra that isn't <br>
                an uncommo occurance. However, there are many great resources online that can help the learning process. One in particular is the playlist<br>
